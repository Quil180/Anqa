# Anqa: A Personal RISC-V Processor Project  

**Anqa** is a personal project focused on designing and implementing a RISC-V processor from the ground up. The goal is to develop a functional **RV32I processor** while documenting the process for others to follow and build their own. The project is currently in progress, with work completed on **the instruction set architecture (ISA) documentation and the foundational 32-bit adder design**.

## **Current Progress**  
âœ” **RV32I ISA Documentation** â€“ A breakdown of 36 instructions in my own words, including immediate operations, register-register operations, store/load instructions, and branching.  
âœ” **Adder Design** â€“ Implemented a hierarchical approach to building a **32-bit adder** using half adders, full adders, and scalable multi-bit adder structures.  
âœ” **Implementation Plan** â€“ The processor will be developed in **Verilog using Vivado 2024.2**.  

## **Next Steps**  
ðŸ”¹ **Designing the ALU** â€“ Implementing arithmetic, logical, and branching operations.  
ðŸ”¹ **Register File Implementation** â€“ Creating a 32-register system for data storage.  
ðŸ”¹ **Instruction Fetch & Decode** â€“ Setting up the pipeline for executing RISC-V instructions.  

## **How to Follow Along**  
This repository will include detailed documentation and Verilog implementations, allowing others to **replicate and modify the design** for personal learning or research. Updates will be made as progress continues.
